# Tutorials and Learning Pathways

In this section, we group tutorials into different learning pathways to help you progressively build the skills needed to master EarthCODE. Whether you're just starting or aiming to become an expert, each pathway is designed to guide you through key concepts and features of EarthCODE. You’ll gain practical, hands-on experience as you move from basic to advanced topics, ensuring that you can apply your learning effectively in real-world research projects.

## Start Simple
For those new to EarthCODE, this pathway covers the basics to get you up and running quickly. Learn the fundamental features, how to set up your environment, and perform simple tasks that are essential for beginning your EarthCODE journey. You’ll start with simple tasks like accessing and browsing data, and gradually move toward publishing data and workflows. Example tutorials may include Jupyter Notebooks for tasks such as:

- Accessing public datasets from Earth observation platforms.
- Browsing data using simple queries.
- Executing basic analysis and visualizing results.
- [Cubes & Clouds](https://eo-college.org/courses/cubes-and-clouds/): This course teaches the concepts of data cubes, cloud platforms, and open science in the context of earth observation.  

## Grow Your Skills
Once you're familiar with the basics, this pathway takes you deeper into EarthCODE. Explore more advanced functionalities, such as configuring workflows, working with larger datasets, and collaborating with other researchers. You’ll gain practical experience in applying EarthCODE’s tools to enhance your research projects. Example tutorials may include:

- Setting up and executing more complex workflows using different platforms.
- Collaborative data sharing and version control.
- Publishing results and workflows to the Open Science Catalog.

You'll also work with Jupyter Notebooks for more advanced tasks like analyzing geospatial data and automating workflows.

## Excel with EarthCODE
This pathway is for advanced users looking to maximize the potential of EarthCODE. Learn best practices for optimizing workflows, managing large datasets, and contributing to the EarthCODE community. You’ll also explore expert-level features to take your research to the next level, fostering innovation and collaboration. End-to-end workflows will be demonstrated using a set of Jupyter Notebooks across different platforms (e.g., Copernicus Data Space, Euro Data Cube) to execute comprehensive experiments, including:

- Data preprocessing and advanced analytics.
- Creating and managing large-scale scientific workflows.
- Publishing and sharing results in collaborative research environments.

For real-world examples, check out these case studies:

- Case Study 1 - [Sentinel-1 for Science Amazonas](https://project.gisat.cz/s14scienceAmazonas/): In this ESA-funded project, EarthCODE and openEO were used to assess how Sentinel-1 imagery can estimate forest carbon losses and gains due to land use and land cover changes in the Amazon basin. This project emphasizes EarthCODE's integration with external platforms to process and analyze large geospatial datasets.
- Case Study 2 - [SARwave](https://www.sarwave.org/): This case study demonstrates the use of EarthCODE in creating and refining S1L1B and S1L2 products. By collocating data from the WW3 model with Sentinel-1 (S1L1B) products, researchers can generate S1L1C and ultimately refined wind and wave products. These advanced processing steps are essential for analyzing sea state conditions, such as wave height and period, through data sources like SARwave and the Euro Data Cube platform.

## NoR Training: A Key to Collaborative Research and Resource Management
As part of your journey with EarthCODE, NoR Training is an essential component to learn how to fully leverage the Network of Resources (NoR). The NoR network enables users to connect with various data resources, tools, and services within EarthCODE, as well as collaborate effectively with other researchers across platforms. Understanding NoR is critical because it:

- Facilitates efficient resource management by helping you access and share datasets, workflows, and research outputs.
- Provides the foundation for seamless collaboration within the EarthCODE community, making it easier to contribute to joint research projects and innovations.
- Teaches you how to connect your workflows to external resources, increasing the scope and scalability of your research.

This training will guide you through the process of utilizing NoR to access and manage resources, connect with other researchers, and publish your findings. By learning how to integrate NoR with other EarthCODE tools, you will be equipped to conduct high-impact, collaborative research.
