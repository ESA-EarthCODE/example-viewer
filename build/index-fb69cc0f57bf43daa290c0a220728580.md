# Getting started with EarthCODE

## Welcome to EarthCODE!

This page serves as your starting point for exploring the platform. Whether you're a newcomer, a student, an expert, or simply someone interested in using EarthCODE, this guide will help you get started.

There are two ways to explore EarthCODE:

1. **Follow a step-by-step onboarding pathway** – If you're new to EarthCODE, we recommend following these steps to build a strong foundation:

   * [Step 1: Understand EarthCODE Terminology](#step-1-understand-earthcode-terminology)
   * [Step 2: Explore EarthCODE](#step-2-explore-earthcode)
   * [Step 3: Understand Your Role in the EarthCODE Community](#step-3-understand-your-role-in-the-earthcode-community)
   * [Step 4: Start Experimenting with EarthCODE](#step-4-start-experimenting-with-earthcode)

2. **Jump straight to what you need** – If you’re short on time or already familiar with EarthCODE, you can go directly to specific topics:

   * [10 minutes to EarthCODE](./10%20minutes%20to%20EarthCODE.md) – A quick overview to get started fast
   * [Deep Dive into EarthCODE](./Deep%20Dive%20into%20EarthCODE.md) – Advanced features and in-depth guidance
   * [Connecting External Platforms to EarthCODE](./Connecting%20External%20Platforms%20to%20EarthCODE.md) – Integration of tools into EarthCODE
   * [Troubleshooting and Support](./Troubleshooting%20and%20Support.md) – Help when you need it

Whichever path you choose, this guide will support your journey as you engage with the EarthCODE community.

## Step 1: Understand EarthCODE Terminology

Familiarize yourself with the [key terms and concepts](./key-terms-and-concepts.md) used in EarthCODE. Understanding the terminology will help you navigate the platform and engage with the community effectively.

## Step 2: Explore EarthCODE

Take some time to explore EarthCODE’s core features. 
This step will help you become familiar with the platform's tools and resources, and how they integrate to support your research.
The best way to follow our tutorials and learn about EarthCODE is by using one of the EarthCODE platforms. We recommend visiting the page where we explain how [to choose the right tools and platforms for your work](../Technical%20Documentation/Platforms/).
Once you're familiar with that, dive deeper into the platform by exploring:

- [EarthCODE Data](../Technical%20Documentation/Data/): Access a variety of datasets available for your research needs.
- [EarthCODE Workflows](../Technical%20Documentation/Workflows/): Learn how to create, manage, and optimize workflows to enhance your research.
By exploring these sections, you’ll better understand how to leverage EarthCODE’s resources and tools to support your research.


### EarthCODE platforms

Visit the [EarthCODE platforms](../Technical%20Documentation/Platforms/) page to learn about the different EarthCODE platforms. There, you will find their respective documentation and instructions on how to access resources.

### Tutorials

This compiled table will take you through the basics of EarthCODE. You can choose tutorials in various formats: Hands-on and Slides tutorials focus on text-based learning, while Videos and Case Studies provide a more visual approach.

## Events

Check upcoming [EarthCODE events](../Training%20and%20Resources/Events%20and%20Workshops.md) for training sessions that can enhance your learning experience before diving into the tutorials. Learning together can often be more enjoyable and effective!

## Step 3: Understand Your Role in the EarthCODE Community
Understand the opportunities and possibilities within the [EarthCODE community](../Community%20and%20Collaboration/). In this step, you will learn how to identify where you can contribute and how collaboration within the community can enhance your research. This section will help you understand how you can actively participate in shaping the EarthCODE ecosystem.

## Step 4: Start Experimenting with EarthCODE
Once you’ve understood your role and the resources available, it's time to experiment! Use EarthCODE’s tools and platforms to enhance your projects. Bring visibility to your research by experimenting with data, workflows, and collaborative features. This step is all about applying what you've learned and experimenting with real data in EarthCODE, contributing to the ecosystem through hands-on work.
