# Working with Data

The Working with Data section provides detailed instructions on how to efficiently access, manage, and use data within the EarthCODE environment. This includes discovering and accessing datasets through the Open Science Catalog, uploading and managing your own data, and incorporating datasets into your workflows for analysis and processing. These subsections will guide you through the steps needed to ensure seamless integration of data into your research projects.

- [Data Discovery and Access](Discovering%20Resources%20in%20The%20EarthCODE%20Catalog): You will learn how to search for and access data through the Open Science Catalog. It covers instructions on using metadata and dependencies, helping you locate relevant datasets for your research. Additionally, you will gain insight into how to utilize APIs for automated access to data.
- [Uploading and Managing Your Data](Contributing%20to%20the%20EarthCODE%20Catalog): Here, you will find guidelines on how to upload your own datasets to EarthCODE. This includes managing data storage, handling file formats, and applying version control to ensure the integrity and traceability of your datasets over time. The section also covers best practices for organizing and categorizing your data for easier retrieval.

- [Using Data in Workflows](Using%20Data%20in%20Workflows): This subsection explains how to incorporate data into your workflows and experiments within EarthCODE. It provides step-by-step instructions on integrating external datasets into your research workflows, enabling you to perform analysis, processing, and visualization tasks in an efficient and reproducible manner.
