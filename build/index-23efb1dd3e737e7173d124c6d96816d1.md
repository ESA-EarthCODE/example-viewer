# Engaging with the EarthCode Community
 
In this section, you will find everything you need to engage with the EarthCODE community. Learn how to collaborate with others, explore community initiatives, and access discussions on the EarthCODE Forum. Whether you're looking to share knowledge, contribute to projects, or connect with like-minded researchers, this is your gateway to active participation.

- [The EarthCODE Forum](./Getting%20Started%20With%20The%20EarthCODE%20Discourse/): The EarthCODE Forum is where the community connects, collaborates, and discusses ideas. Participate in conversations, ask questions, and contribute to ongoing projects with fellow researchers.
- [Open Science Collaboration Teams](./Collaboration%20and%20Community/): Open Science Collaboration Teams allow you to either join existing research teams or set up new ones. This section will guide you on how to get involved in collaborative Open Science initiatives, sharing knowledge and research efforts with others in the EarthCODE community.
