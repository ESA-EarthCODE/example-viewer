Reusable) provide a structured approach to managing data, ensuring that both data and processing workflows can be efficiently discovered, accessed, and used across disciplines. Given the increasing volume and complexity of Earth Observation (EO) data—ranging from satellite imagery to in situ measurements—FAIR principles are essential for enabling automated discovery, seamless integration, and reproducible science.\n\nFAIR is not just about data; software, models, and workflows must also be FAIR to ensure full reproducibility of scientific analyses. This requires:\n\nFAIR metadata for software and workflows, ensuring clear documentation of inputs, outputs, dependencies, and provenance.\n\nPersistent identifiers (PIDs) for datasets, algorithms, and workflows to support traceability and reuse.\n\nInteroperable formats and standards, such as netCDF, Zarr, and STAC for data, or CWL (Common Workflow Language) for workflow portability, OGC API - Processes for standardized execution, and openEO for cloud-based EO data processing, ensuring compatibility across platforms.\n\nAccessible computing environments, such as the \n\ncloud-based processing platforms available in EarthCODE, which allow users to execute EO workflows.\n\nFAIR does not imply that data or software must be open by default, but rather that they are well-described, structured, and reusable under appropriate conditions. By applying FAIR principles to both data and processing, the EO community can enhance scientific transparency, improve cross-disciplinary collaboration, and enable scalable, automated analysis—key for addressing global challenges like climate change, disaster response, and biodiversity conservation.","type":"content","url":"/external-notebooks/earthcode/documentation/pages/community-and-best-practices/fair-and-open-science#a-conceptual-overview-of-fair-principles","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"FAIR and Open Science","lvl3":"A Deep Dive into the FAIR Principles","lvl2":"From FAIR Principles to FAIR in Practice"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/external-notebooks/earthcode/documentation/pages/community-and-best-practices/fair-and-open-science#a-deep-dive-into-the-fair-principles","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"FAIR and Open Science","lvl3":"A Deep Dive into the FAIR Principles","lvl2":"From FAIR Principles to FAIR in Practice"},"content":"Everyone knows F, A, I, and R, but the FAIR Guiding Principles consist of 15 one-liners that define the key behaviors necessary for making data and services machine-actionable.

This is similar to what other platforms might call a “thread.”\n\nPost: An individual message within a topic. Each post can be authored by different users, moved to another topic, or become the start of a new topic.\n\nOriginal Post (OP): The first post in any topic. It determines the focus of the topic and is associated with the title and tags.\n\nCategory: The primary way of organizing topics. Each topic resides in one category, which can have its own permissions and notification settings. Categories are similar to forums on other sites.\n\nTag: A marker used to describe a topic. Each topic can have multiple tags and users can create new ones.\n\nUser: All site activities, like creating posts and recording actions, are centered around registered users. Discourse sites may be private or public, but registration is required for participation.\n\n:information_source: For more details, see the \n\nInterface Nomenclature Guide.","type":"content","url":"/external-notebooks/earthcode/documentation/pages/community-and-collaboration/getting-started-with-the-earthcode-discourse/earthcode-discourse-basics#basic-terms-used-by-discourse","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"EarthCODE Discourse Basics","lvl3":"EarthCODE Login"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/external-notebooks/earthcode/documentation/pages/community-and-collaboration/getting-started-with-the-earthcode-discourse/earthcode-discourse-basics#earthcode-login","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"EarthCODE Discourse Basics","lvl3":"EarthCODE Login"},"content":"EarthCODE Discourse provides a seamless login experience by using the same credentials you already use (Github account) for the EarthCODE platform.

If you’re new to STAC and only have a few data assets, this approach can work, but it is prone to errors.\n\nManually editing STAC Items can be tedious, and extracting all the required metadata correctly can be challenging. For most Item Catalogs, we recommend using automated tools, for example:\n\nThe \n\nstactools CLI provides a simple command-line interface for generating STAC Items. With the \n\nstactools-datacube extension even following the STAC datacube extension.\n\nA combination of \n\nPySTAC to create the Catalog and \n\nrio-stac for automatically generating valid STAC Items with all required metadata.\n\nTypically, this workflow starts by defining individual STAC objects (a Catalog and its Items). Once created, these objects are linked together using STAC relationships.\n\nIn the final step, the Catalog is saved and normalized to a specified root directory. At this stage, you can choose to set the Catalog type to “self-contained”. When enabled, this ensures that all internal links are automatically resolved and adjusted to be relative, making the Catalog portable and independent of absolute file paths.\n\nThe process is straightforward, and we highly recommend checking out \n\nthis notebook.Regardless of how you create the catalog, it must be **self-contained**. This means:\n- Internal links should use **relative paths** (e.g., `\"../catalog.json\"` instead of `\"/Users/name/catalog/catalog.json\"`).\n- Data asset paths should point to **remote storage**, not local files on your system.","type":"content","url":"/external-notebooks/earthcode/documentation/pages/technical-documentation/data/contributing-to-the-earthcode-catalog#creating-the-item-catalog","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Publishing Science Results","lvl3":"Uploading the Item Catalog","lvl2":"Step 2: Creating and uploading a STAC Item Catalog"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/external-notebooks/earthcode/documentation/pages/technical-documentation/data/contributing-to-the-earthcode-catalog#uploading-the-item-catalog","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Publishing Science Results","lvl3":"Uploading the Item Catalog","lvl2":"Step 2: Creating and uploading a STAC Item Catalog"},"content":"The Item Catalog must be hosted separately from the Open Science Catalog, and like the data files, it should be persistent and publicly accessible.\n\nSince the Item Catalog only contains metadata (JSON) files rather than actual datasets, a simple and effective solution is to store it in a public repository, such as GitHub. This approach is demonstrated in the \n\nCreating an Item Catalog notebook.\n\nAlternatively, if you have access to a reliable cloud storage service—such as the EarthCODE object storage bucket—you can host your Item Catalog there.\n\nIf you choose to use the ESA PRR the generated STAC Items have to be sent via POST requests to the \n\nPRR Registration Gateway for registration using the previously requested collection.\n\nThe only requirement is that other users and the STAC browser must be able to find and read your repository!In the next step where you will be uploading metadata to the Open Science Catalog, EarthCODE administrators will review your Item Catalog and assist you with any necessary adjustments.

This allows data providers like projects PI to apply multiple changes or adding several new products at once.\n\nWork is underway to provide a CMS-like GUI based editing functionality using \n\ngit-clerk via the EarthCODE Portal. Although this GUI approach is still relying on GitHub the complexity is abstracted and hidden to the user.\n\nIn this section the contribution procedure is described in an example for a Product. Please note that in the same way new Variables, Projects, Themes, EO Missions, Workflows, and Experiments can be added. We will be using three Use Case scenarios to better describe the procedure of product ingestion to the catalog:\n\nAdding metadata of a single product (item) to the catalog manually.\n\nIngesting metadata of assets with STAC Catalog:\n\nAdding multiple or single product(s) stored in external server (open-access storage)\n\nAdding multiple or single product(s) stored locally","type":"content","url":"/external-notebooks/earthcode/documentation/pages/technical-documentation/data/contributing-to-the-earthcode-catalog#how-to-publish-new-data-to-the-catalog","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Publishing Science Results","lvl3":"Which information is needed before I start importing new data?","lvl2":"Step 3: Creating a Product entry in the OSC"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/external-notebooks/earthcode/documentation/pages/technical-documentation/data/contributing-to-the-earthcode-catalog#which-information-is-needed-before-i-start-importing-new-data","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Publishing Science Results","lvl3":"Which information is needed before I start importing new data?","lvl2":"Step 3: Creating a Product entry in the OSC"},"content":"Before making any changes to the catalog’s content please make sure you have already prepared the following information about your product:\n\nThe Product should be related to a result of an ESA-funded project.
